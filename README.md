Originally was using google docs as a makeshift repository for this project

First upload contians the following:
- Reads in periodic table and puts in a list
- Interface with a total of 3 elements for testing purposes
  - Enter the number of each element and it creates of list of element objects and adds each individual element
- Integrated tree data structure class
- AI
  - Checks to see if element objects fit node criteria
  - Adds and Removes nodes from the tree data structure
  - Edits nodes as they are added
